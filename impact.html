        <h1>Impact of Temperature Rise on Global Mean Sea Level</h1>
        <p>Global warming, due to the increased greenhouse effect, not only leads to higher temperatures but also has a significant impact on our oceans. The rising temperatures cause the sea levels to rise due to the melting of polar ice caps and thermal expansion of the water. This chart displays the changes in global mean sea level from 1880 to 2015.</p>

        <p>The rise in global mean sea level poses a significant threat to coastal communities and ecosystems. The frequency and severity of coastal flooding and erosion are expected to increase, leading to loss of property and habitats. Understanding these trends is crucial in preparing for and mitigating the impacts of sea-level rise.</p>
