        <h1>Temperature Anomaly Over Time</h1>
        <p>Global warming, a long-term increase in the average temperature in the Earth's climate system, is an important aspect of climate change that has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of warming. This graph illustrates the changes in temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2023. The temperature anomaly is the deviation from the average temperature or baseline. A positive anomaly means that the observed temperature was warmer than the baseline, while a negative anomaly means that the observed temperature was cooler than the baseline.</p>

        <p>Looking at the graph, there is a clear trend of increasing temperature anomalies over the last century. This pattern is consistent with the widespread scientific understanding of global warming. The changes in our global climate are caused primarily by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These activities are amplifying the natural greenhouse effect and causing the Earth's surface temperature to rise. Recognizing and understanding these trends is the first step to mitigating the impacts and developing sustainable solutions for our future.</p>
